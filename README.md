Title：
Unveiling Hydrogen Fluoride Emission Mechanisms in Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Using a Machine Learning Approach

Abstract：
Hydrogen fluoride (HF) emissions from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) pose significant environmental and health risks, yet their complex formation mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study presents an integrated machine learning framework combining XGBoost for HF prediction, SHAP for feature interpretation, structural equation modeling (SEM) for mechanistic analysis, generalized additive models (GAM) for threshold identification, and self-adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SA-NSGA-II) for multi-parameter optimization. Using over 150,000 high-frequency (5-second interval) sensor records from a waste-to-energy plant in Hainan Province, China (June 1–10, 2024), the XGBoost model achieved strong predictive performance (R² = 0.755, RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.031) via 5-fold cross-validation. SHAP analysis identified flue gas temperatures—especially those of the second flue right side (10.97%) and first flue top (8.24%)—as dominant factors. SEM confirmed the grate incineration zone as the primary HF source (path coefficient = 1.058, p < 0.001). GAM identified critical temperature thresholds at 762 °C, 875 °C, and 212 °C for effective emission control. SA-NSGA-II optimization, validated using June 11 data, reduced HF emissions in 89.74% of cases, achieving an average reduction of 17.61% (0.1176 mg/m³). This framework advances mechanistic understanding and provides data-driven strategies for sustainable MSWI operation and pollution mitigation.
